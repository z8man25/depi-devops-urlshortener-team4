Objective

Design, containerize, and monitor a scalable URL shortener service. The project aims to provide a simple yet efficient application for generating and managing short links, while ensuring visibility into system performance through integrated monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana). All components will be deployed and orchestrated locally using Docker.

Description

The project involves building a URL shortening web service that allows users to create, store, and manage shortened links with quick redirections. The application will be containerized to ensure portability and consistency across environments. To maintain reliability and track performance, the service will expose metrics that Prometheus collects, while Grafana provides interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring and analysis. This setup delivers both functionality and observability in one cohesive environment.
