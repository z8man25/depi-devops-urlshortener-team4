## 🎯 Objective  

Design, containerize, and monitor a scalable URL shortener service. The project aims to provide a simple yet efficient application for generating and managing short links, while ensuring visibility into system performance through integrated monitoring tools (Prometheus and Grafana). All components will be deployed and orchestrated locally using Docker.

## 📖 Description  

This project focuses on developing a lightweight web application that shortens URLs, stores the mapping data, and manages redirections.  

- The application will be **containerized** to guarantee portability and consistency across environments.  
- The service will be **instrumented with metrics**, enabling performance monitoring.  
- **Prometheus** will collect metrics and **Grafana** will visualize them through interactive dashboards.  

This setup provides both functionality and observability in a unified environment.
